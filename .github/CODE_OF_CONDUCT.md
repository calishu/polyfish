# Code of Conduct

## Scope
Every entity that interacts with the repository or the community, whether by submitting pull requests, creating issues, participating in discussions on GitHub, or using official community areas, will be taken into account.\
Only unofficial community areas are excluded.

## Our Standards
We prohibit any behavior that disrupts the peace in the repository or community and/or harms users or the community.\
\
Examples include:
- Violence or self-harm
- Use of sexualized language or images, as well as unwanted sexual advances
- Trolling, intentional dissemination of misinformation, abusive/derogatory comments, and personal attacks of any kind
- Harassment in public or private
- Publishing the private information of others, whether physical or digital, without verifiable and explicit consent
- Advocating, inciting, or threatening the above-mentioned behaviors
- Any other behavior that could be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities of the community
Should anyone discover a violation of this code of conduct, they are obliged to report it to the project maintainers and community moderators by creating a issue in the `COC Report` category.

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers and moderators are responsible for responding appropriately to inappropriate behavior.\
\
Community moderators have the right and the duty to edit, remove, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not comply with the Code of Conduct. They may also temporarily or permanently block any contributor who behaves inappropriately, threateningly, abusively, or harmfully, provided they can demonstrate the reason and justify the legality of their actions.\
\
Project maintainers have the same rights and responsibilities as community moderators. In addition, they may take action, with or without evidence or approval, and may amend this Code of Conduct at any time, except for additional rules specific to individual entities.\
\
Neither community moderators nor project maintainers can guarantee compliance with the Code of Conduct, but they will make every effort to ensure it.
